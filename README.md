## What is MongoDB Atlas?
MongoDB Atlas is a fully managed cloud version of MongoDB, a popular NoSQL database for build small to enterprise level applications.  But although MongoDB is open-source, scalable, and features high availability as well as support for complex queries and fine concurrency control, MongoDB Atlas provides an easy alternative to installing, tuning for optimal performance and security a database on the cloud for your own project.

## What can you do with MongoDB Atlas?
With Atlas, you can create a MongoDB **cluster** on any major cloud provider (AWS, etc.) and use that cluster within minutes with a browser-based interface.  Additionally, you can allocate cloud resources and have the database automatically set itself up with predefined rules and further monitor its performance.
